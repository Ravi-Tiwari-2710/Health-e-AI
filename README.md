# Health-e-AI

• The basic objective of the idea is to measure patient health parameters such as body 
temperature, heart rate (BPM), blood oxygen levels (Sp02) through a wearable device 
and send it to a cloud platform so that it can be monitor from any device that support 
browsing capabilities.
• It can send the alert to the doctor and call ambulance when needed so that the 
medical help can be provided at time.
• AI algorithm is then applied to the collected data to analyze the condition of patient so 
that necessary action can be taken at time. It is also able to predict heart attack 
pneumonia, malaria, cancer and major diseases so that required action can be taken
